*** NOTE: The repository will be changing soon! I will be reuploading a better version of the program's base soon.

Hi there! Welcome to the GitHub repository for The Most Complete Charting Program (MCP). MCP is a free and open source program that aims to be the most feature-packed and complete rhythm game charting program with support for a multitude of games that support the creation of custom charts. It is based off of Moonscraper Chart Editor (MSCE) and Editor on Fire (EOF) for its GUI design.

If you wish to contribute, and are experienced in programming, feel free to!

The program is written in Python.

The following games are currently supported with this program:
- All Guitar Hero (or similar style) rhythm games that support customs (.CHART, .MID):
	- Guitar Hero III
	- Guitar Hero III: Aerosmith
	- Guitar Hero World Tour
	- Guitar Hero World Tour Definitive Edition
	- Clone Hero
	- Rock Band 2
	- Rock Band 3
	- Phase Shift

The following is a list of features and editing tools planned to be implemented:
- Versatile UI: The graphical user interface (GUI) will be aimed at users of Moonscraper or EOF, with an option to turn the highway horizontal (default) or vertical. It will also have all of its commands in a modular window style, so the user can customize the appearance of the interface to their liking.

- Multiply BPM: Option to change the BPM of a song by a given factor, not affecting note position (unless specified).
